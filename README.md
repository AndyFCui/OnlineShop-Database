//Top level description
//Introduction
//Our group intends to design a Robot Store Management System which is designed for offline management of small supermarkets. It allows customers and system operators to access the system. This system enables customers and  operators to log in or sign up for their account. For a customer, it is easy to check order details, create new orders and submit refund requests. Each order is checked by a specific operator and the operator arranges the order process of confirmation and delivery and deals with the possible refund request.
//Language
//We decided to use SQL storage combined with python and this system will be tested and used on PC.
In the python to database connection programs, we intend to use mysql queries to establish a connection to MySQL and build the database structure. If a form already exists and someone wants to submit a command to the form, we need to return the data. It will use all mysql queries to build an offline version database system. 
Options function
We might create a web frame to get the bonus point, it might use Django to build a web interface, if we have enough time. 
Inspiration for topic selection
All of our group members are interested in technology and science. We did a survey and found the number of robot stores is growing at a fast rate.
So, we discussed and finally decided to design a management system to help these stores to operate.
